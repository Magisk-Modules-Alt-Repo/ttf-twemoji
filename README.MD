# Twemoji replacer

This module changes Google Noto Emoji to Twitter Emoji.

## Description

Uses the [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)'s twitter-twemoji-fonts package because it's already in [CBDT/CBLC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directwrite/color-fonts#what-kinds-of-color-fonts-does-windows-support) format (the one used in Android and Chrome).

I took inspiration from [ttf-twemoji](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-twemoji/) over from the Arch Linux User Repository to get the compatible font.

I do not own the graphics, nor the font files, I'm just sharing them in a way that is easy for everyone to enjoy.

The module is confirmed to work in LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11) and Magisk 20+. But apparently doesn't seem to work on Android 12.
